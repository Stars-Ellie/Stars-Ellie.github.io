            Elanor as the flower in the Lord of The Rings.
            I'm the oldest sibling, then my sister, then brother and last baby sister.
            I live with my dad and siblings.
            I have two cat King, and Bebe I love them alot.
            King is my black cat who hunts bugs and loves people.
            His sister Bebe is a gray cat. She had two litters of kittens that all got homes.

            I have loved making art since I was a child.
            The first time I got in the art show was in 1st grade and I still get more of my art in the art show.
            I've made pottery, painting, watercolor painting, digital, and drawing in my sketchbook.My favorite art
            medium
            right now is watercolor.
            I made birthday cards for my friends with watercolor. My least favorite medium is painting. It is hard to
            paint
            with a plan.
            I want to get better at painting, draw backgounds.
